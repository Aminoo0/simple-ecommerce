# about project and what i used to build it

I used next js for SEO using meta data 
And also because it is server side render(ssr)
and dynamic routing
I made search bar that search by name
I used talwind css for user interface and responsively app
i made Loading States with react Suspense Component
i try to make that code clean and made simple structure for files
